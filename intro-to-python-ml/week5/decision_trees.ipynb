    "## What is recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand Decision Trees, let us first understand what is recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion happens when a function calls itself. The idea is to reduce the problem into a simpler version of the same problem until you reduce it to what we call the *base case*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several math functions are naturally recursive. For example, *factorial*. Here's an example of factorial: `6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 120`. You can also write it like this: `6! = 6 * 5!`. In this way, we've reduced it to a simpler version of the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fact(n):\n",
    "    if n == 0:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    return n * fact(n - 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Fibonacci is another commonly seen example. The Fibonacci sequence is constructed by summing the two previous numbers to get the next number. Here's the sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 21, 33, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fibonacci(n):\n",
    "    if n <= 1:\n",
    "        return n\n",
    "    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also write a sum function, which sums a list, recursively:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sum(lst):\n",
    "    if not lst:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    return lst[0] + sum(lst[1:])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that every recursive problem has two cases (can be more too):\n",
    "\n",
    "* The *Base Case*: This is the stopping point or minimal example. It's an empty list or when an integer is 0. It's the simplest problem that can't be reduced any more.\n",
    "* The *Recursive Step*: This is where all the work is done. We reduce the problem into a smaller version of the same problem (in solving factorial of n we reduced the problem to solving factorial of n - 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trees\n",
    "The examples above can also be easily written *iteratively* (using loops instead of recursion), but there are instances where recursion is really key.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *tree* in computer science is a *data structure* (way of storing data) which looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "         8\n",
    "       /   \\\n",
    "      5     7\n",
    "       \\   / \\\n",
    "        3 1   2\n",
    "             /\n",
    "            6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using them for *decision trees* (discussed below). You can think of those as a flow chart:\n",

    "- [Decision trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) are one of the most popular and widely used algorithms in industry today. \n",
    "- Most classifiers (SVM, kNN, Naive Bayes) are great at giving you a (somewhat) accurate result, but are often black boxes in that it can be hard to interpret their parameters and thus *understand why* a certain instance was assigned a specific label. Regressions provide a middle ground in that it is possible to assign relationships between features and targets but it is often to assign a causal relationship amongst the inputs \n",

Intuitively, if a set has all the same labels, that'll have low entropy and if it has a mix of labels, that's high entropy. We would like to create splits that minimize the entropy in each size.

    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are prone to overfitting. If we have a lot of features and they all get used in building our tree, we will build a tree that perfectly represents our training data but is not general. A way to relax this is *pruning*. The idea is that we may not want to continue building the tree until all the leaves are pure (have only datapoints of one class). There are two main ways of pruning: *prepruning* and *postpruning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepruning\n",
    "*Prepruning* is making the decision tree algorithm stop early. Here are a few ways that we preprune:\n",
    "\n",
    "* leaf size: Stop when the number of data points for a leaf gets below a threshold\n",
    "* depth: Stop when the depth of the tree (distance from root to leaf) reaches a threshold\n",
    "* mostly the same: Stop when some percent of the data points are the same (rather than all the same)\n",
    "* error threshold: Stop when the error reduction (information gain) isn't improved significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Postpruning\n",
    "As the name implies, *postpruning* involves building the tree first and then choosing to cut off some of the leaves (shorten some of the branches, the tree analogy really works well here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, the second approach of post-pruning overfit trees is more successful because it is not easy to precisely estimate when to stop growing the tree. \n",
